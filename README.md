　　父亲坐在甲板的椅子上，目视着远方，静静的一动不动。但我知道，父亲的心朝一定和这海波一般起伏动荡着，想必父亲的心绪也随着海风飘过了海峡，让自己孤寂的灵魂远航。其实，我们每一个人的灵魂都在独行，都在寻找着一个目标，那就是上帝。当你遇到了另一个独行的灵魂，并和他相爱了，两个灵魂也不会同行，所以灵魂永远是独行的，我们常常感到孤独。
　　第欧根尼睁开眼睛，一个身穿披紫色头篷、眼光灼灼有神的年青人站在他眼前，而在此人死后，是黑漆漆的人群。

Father sitting on the deck chair and watched the distant place, quietly move.
But I know, father's heart toward certain volatile and the waves, and presumably father's mood also along with the sea breeze across the strait, let your lonely soul sail.
In fact, we each person's soul is in alone, looking for a goal, that is god.
When did you meet another lone soul, and fell in love with him, two souls will not, so the soul is always alone, we often feel lonely.
Diogenes opened his eyes, wearing a purple head covered, beating his young man standing in front of his eyes, and after the death of the person, is dark.
